/*
The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

Note:
0 â‰¤ x, y < 231. 

My Own Notes:
    8421
    ----
9 = 1001
3 = 0011
    ---- diff? <----- XOR.   (and, or, xor). 
10= 1010 = 2 bits with 1 on.
